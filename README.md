# IMFAST HUD Demo

A real-time visualization demonstrating how the IMFAST dimensional system tracks experiential states frame-by-frame.

## What Is This?

This is a proof-of-concept HUD (heads-up display) showing how consciousness could be formally tracked using the six-dimensional IMFAST coordinate system proposed in **Game Theory 2.0: Experiential Patterns as Playable Formalisms**.

The demo shows both compact and expanded HUD formats displaying how experiential coordinates shift during a simple 10-second walking scenario. Each "frame" represents a complete snapshot of consciousness at that moment.

## The IMFAST System

**I**dentity - How the sense of self is structured  
**M**entality - The quality and mode of thinking  
**F**ocus - How attention is allocated and controlled  
**A**ffect - Valence across experiential channels  
**S**ensory - Which perceptual channel is dominant  
**T**emporal - How time-sense and flow feel  

Each dimension has 7 discrete states, creating a coordinate space for specifying any experiential moment.

## Features

- **Compact HUD**: Minimal game-style corner display with position dots
- **Expanded HUD**: Full labels, state names, and visual progress bars
- **Frame-by-frame navigation**: Step through experiential states manually
- **Auto-play mode**: Watch coordinates shift in real-time
- **Scene descriptions**: Text context linking HUD readouts to actual experience

## The Demo Sequence

Watch how coordinates shift during a walk through the park:

1. **Relaxed walking** - Embodied identity, peaceful affect, flowing time
2. **Notice bird** - Attention narrows, visual sense dominates
3. **Memory triggered** - Mind wanders to past, displaced temporal sense
4. **Phone vibrates** - Captured focus, tense affect, tactile dominance
5. **Resume walking** - Return to body awareness and flow state

## Technical Implementation

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no dependencies. The demo uses:
- Color-coded dimensions for quick recognition
- Smooth transitions between states
- Looping animation with manual frame control
- Responsive grid layout

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a browser. Use the controls:
- **◀ PREV** - Previous experiential frame
- **▶ PLAY** - Auto-play through sequence
- **NEXT ▶** - Next experiential frame

## The Vision

This demo illustrates a key claim from Game Theory 2.0: experiential patterns can be formally specified and implemented as playable systems. Future applications could include:

- Real-time consciousness tracking in VR/AR
- Research tools for phenomenology and meditation studies
- Therapeutic applications for emotional awareness
- AI alignment through formal modeling of suffering
- Educational tools for teaching experiential literacy

## Philosophy Behind the Design

From **Experiential Empiricism**: Experience is foundational. All knowledge, including scientific knowledge, consists of patterns within experience. The IMFAST system attempts to formalize those patterns using the same precision that game designers use when creating reproducible experiential states.

This HUD is what a "consciousness debugger" might look like - a tool for seeing the structure of experience itself.

*"If each moment is complete, we should be able to model a complete moment. And if we can model moments, we can manipulate experiential patterns systematically. This is what game designers already do. Game Theory 2.0 makes that practice explicit and rigorous."*
